-> I am trying to make an Audio Visualizer. It takes the input of music through a microphone and processes and displays the respective colour in RGB strip or LED.

Current Steps:-

-> Working on the input from the microphone in the Arduino

-> Calculating frequency and amplitude and associating it to an RGB Value, using FFT on the Audio Sample.

-> Putting the value in RGB Led for the output.

-> Connect LEDs in a pattern for visual representation.


Current Status:- Due to midterms I am not able to get Neopixel LED strips thus waiting to get back to continue this project as of now I just to associate the RGB value with each frequency range.
